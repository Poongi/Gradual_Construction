I
was
to
young
to
ever
know
much
about
prince
but
in
the
past
few
years
I
've
seen
a
lot
of
Purple
Rain
Novelty
Tee
's
and
i
thought
they
were
cool
but
i
did
n't
want
to
buy
a
shirt
i
knew
nothing
about
.
So
one
Saturday
it
came
on
fuse
and
i
decided
to
watch
it
.
I
did
n't
know
what
the
movie
was
going
to
be
about
before
i
watched
it
but
it
was
great
once
i
found
out
.
In
the
movie
prince
was
n't
known
as
prince
but
as
"
the
kid
"
.
All
the
performances
where
great
to
me
but
my
favorite
were
Purple
Rain
,
Darling
Nicki
,
and
I
would
die
for
you
.
All
the
songs
tied
into
what
was
going
on
through
out
the
movie
when
his
mother
and
father
were
always
fighting
the
song
when
doves
cried
described
what
he
was
feeling
.
I
also
like
how
clever
prince
was
with
the
way
he
flirted
with
Apallonia
.
I
liked
when
Prince
and
Appallonia
first
met
in
the
club
and
he
stood
behind
her
standing
and
then
once
she
turned
around
he
disappeared
!
great
movie
and
now
i
ca
nt
even
find
one
of
those
tee
shirts
:(
